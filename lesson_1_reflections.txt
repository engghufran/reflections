How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

Diff gives an overview of changes made in both files.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

We can see if something goes horribly wrong and see the previous version.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

Automatic versions create too much clutter, and
Manual version make more sensoe if committed on proper time. It really depends on judgment call.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

To keep track of the whole project which may contain multiple files and have dependencies among files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

Git log gives all the changes made to the file or repository. By using git diff we can compare two files 
and see the changes in color contrast. We can see the lines deleted and added and the modifications made to the code.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
